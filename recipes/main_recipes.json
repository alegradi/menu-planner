It is important they are well sealed inside the foil. If your foil does not wrap all the way around your baking sheet, wrap the rack in tight foil packets and place them on the baking sheet.",

Ribs are ready to come out of the oven when the meat is cooked through and tender. To check, pierce them with a sharp knife. There should be little to no resistance. You can also gently bend the ribs. If the meat looks like it will easily pull away from the bone, they are ready.",
